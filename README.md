# barbuttons-mod

Mod of [BarButtons](https://jaxeadv.com/barbuttons) targeting an **ESP32-C3 Zero** microcontroller.
Two types of changes are covered: firmware and physical casing.

---

## Firmware (`barbuttons_keymap.ino`)

### Overview

Based on the original BarButtons v1 firmware, this version replaces the STA-based OTA workflow with a **self-hosted WiFi Access Point** and a **browser-based configuration interface**.

### Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **AP config mode** | Starts a WiFi AP (`BarButtons-Config` / `barbuttons`) on demand |
| **Web keymap editor** | Browser UI at `http://192.168.4.1` to configure short and long press actions for all 8 buttons |
| **NVS persistence** | Keymap stored in flash via the `Preferences` library; survives reboots and firmware updates |
| **OTA firmware update** | Upload a compiled `.bin` directly from the browser; device reboots automatically |
| **NimBLE BLE HID device** | Composite keyboard + mouse over BLE with secure bonding (Secure Connections, Just Works); CCCD state persisted per peer |
| **LED status indicator** | Blink pattern varies by state — see table below |

### LED blink patterns

| State | ON duration | OFF duration |
|---|---|---|
| BT disconnected | 500 ms | 500 ms |
| Config mode | 100 ms | 3000 ms |
| BT connected | LED off (flashes briefly on keypress) | — |

### Entering / exiting config mode

1. **Hold Button 4 for ~5 seconds** (LED starts flashing rapidly).
2. Connect to WiFi SSID **`BarButtons-Config`**, password **`barbuttons`**.
3. Open **`http://192.168.4.1`** in a browser.
4. **Keymap tab** — set Short Press / Long Press action per button, then click **Save & Reboot**.
5. **Firmware tab** — choose a `.bin` and click **Flash Firmware** for OTA update.
6. **BLE Bonds tab** — click **Clear BLE Bonds & Reboot** if the device no longer auto-connects.
7. To exit config mode **without** any changes, tap Button 4 on the device.

> **Note:** Button 4 long-press is reserved as the config trigger and cannot be remapped.

### Mouse mode (for apps that ignore keyboard input)

Some navigation apps — including **Waze** — do not respond to keyboard or arrow-key events. For those apps you can assign **mouse actions** to any button directly from the web configuration UI:

| Action code | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Mouse Pan Up/Down/Left/Right** | Emulates a left-button micro-drag in the chosen direction — map apps treat this as a pan gesture |
| **Mouse Zoom In** | Sends one scroll-wheel-up tick (zoom in) |
| **Mouse Zoom Out** | Sends one scroll-wheel-down tick (zoom out) |
| **Mouse Click (tap)** | Sends a momentary left-button click — use to dismiss menus or select a destination |
| **Mouse Pinch Zoom In (spread)** | Simulates a two-finger spread gesture at screen centre (zoom in) via the touch-screen digitizer |
| **Mouse Pinch Zoom Out (contract)** | Simulates a two-finger pinch gesture at screen centre (zoom out) via the touch-screen digitizer |

**How cursor centering works:** A HID mouse reports *relative* movement, so each pan event would normally drift the on-screen cursor toward a screen edge, eventually preventing further panning. To avoid this, after every pan drag the firmware immediately sends a second report of equal magnitude in the *opposite* direction — but with the mouse button already **released**. Map apps only pan while the button is held, so this return movement is invisible to the application while the cursor silently returns to its original screen position. The cursor therefore stays centered regardless of how many times you pan.

**How pinch-to-zoom works:** The device includes a third HID report (Report ID 3) that describes a two-contact touch-screen digitizer. When a Pinch Zoom button is pressed the firmware animates two virtual fingers: they start close together at the centre of the screen (coordinate space 0–4096) and then spread apart over ~100 ms (zoom in) or contract over ~100 ms (zoom out). Android's gesture recogniser interprets this as a native pinch-to-zoom, so it works in apps that do not respond to scroll-wheel events. Scroll-wheel zoom (`Mouse Zoom In/Out`) is still available as a lighter-weight alternative — choose whichever works with your app.

The device advertises as a **composite BLE HID device** (keyboard + mouse + touch digitizer, Report IDs 1, 2 and 3). Both keyboard keys and mouse/touch actions can be assigned to different buttons in the same keymap, so you can mix them freely.

> **Important:** Changing the HID descriptor (first flash with mouse support) requires the host to re-enumerate the device.  
> Use **Clear BLE Bonds & Reboot** from the config page, then re-pair your phone.

### Button keymap defaults

| Button | Short press | Long press |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `+` | repeat `+` |
| 2 | `-` | repeat `-` |
| 3 | `n` | `d` |
| 4 | `c`/exit config mode | enter config mode |
| 5 | Up Arrow | repeat Up Arrow |
| 6 | Left Arrow | repeat Left Arrow |
| 7 | Right Arrow | repeat Right Arrow |
| 8 | Down Arrow | repeat Down Arrow |

Long press set to **"Repeat short key"** (value `0`) means the short key auto-repeats while the button is held.
Any other key code sends that key exactly once on long press.

### Pin assignments (ESP32-C3 Zero)

| Signal | GPIO |
|---|---|
| LED | 6 |
| Row 0 | 2 |
| Row 1 | 1 |
| Row 2 | 0 |
| Col 0 | 3 |
| Col 1 | 4 |
| Col 2 | 5 |

### Required libraries

- [Keypad](https://github.com/Chris--A/Keypad)
- [NimBLE-Arduino](https://github.com/h2zero/NimBLE-Arduino)
- `WiFi`, `WebServer`, `Update`, `Preferences` — bundled with the Arduino ESP32 core

### Build & flash

1. Install the **ESP32** board package in Arduino IDE (target board: `ESP32C3 Dev Module` or the equivalent Zero variant).
2. Set **Tools → Partition Scheme** to:
   > **Minimal SPIFFS (1.9 MB APP with OTA / 190 KB SPIFFS)**

   This is required because the sketch exceeds the default 1.28 MB app partition.
3. Set `const int DEBUG = 0;` before a production flash (saves flash and avoids waiting for USB-CDC on boot).
4. Compile and upload via USB.

## Hardware / Casing modifications

The 3-D printed casing was modified from the original BarButtons design as follows:

- **M5 bolts** used instead of the original M4 bolts for the main assembly.
- **Heat-set inserts for M3 bolts** replacing the plain holes for the smaller fasteners.
- **Wemos D1 Mini pocket removed**; the cavity is resized to fit an **ESP32-C3 Zero** (smaller footprint).
- **LED aperture changed to a 5 mm round hole, 5 mm deep**, so the dome of a standard 5 mm LED just barely protrudes at the surface. The original design used a much larger waterproof LED bezel; here the LED is simply pressed into the hole and sealed with RTV silicone.
